Layout resize less than 550px - What happens and why?

When you resize to less than 550px, or any predefined size for that matter the webpage layout reorganizes itself.

This is called media queries.

You can define different media states - I.E Tablets, phones and HD screens.
As your page size changes, so to can the page reshuffle (so to speak) to suit that size.

(phablet is 550px)

From my understanding if you go to a site on your mobile your webpage will automatically resize to say 550px.
All other CSS info not related to that range will not be processed, making it fast to load, whilst the content will stay the same.

and CSS styling will remain the same across all queries - like background color, fonts, images etc....
