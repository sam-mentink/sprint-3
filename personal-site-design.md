Sprint-3 website revision and update

My websites primary purpose.

My sites primary purpose it to help me learn how to build a website and understand the mechanics of it.
The primary purpose of the user/visitor will be see the work i have completed at EDA.

What is the target audience.
Everyone and anyone. Its important to remember there will be visually impaired people visiting the site.

Visitors interacation?
I want visitors to be visually excited when entering the site. For the site to be soft on the eyes and make the visitor want to explore all the pages and information.
I also want it to be simple, so I dont think i will add many bells and whistles to it, bit i think it will be bright.

How will i build my site?
Using the design process.
Figuring out purpose, information, wireframing and then break that down to the build.
